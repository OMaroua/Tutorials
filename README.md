## Setup

### Running the Tutorial Website Locally

The tutorial website is built with Jekyll. To view it with proper styling:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OMaroua/Tutorials.git
cd Tutorials

# Install Jekyll and dependencies (first time only)
bundle install

# Serve the website locally
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Open your browser to http://localhost:4000/Tutorials/
```

**Important:** Don't open the HTML/MD files directly in your browser - they won't have styling! Always use Jekyll to serve the site.

### Running the Tutorial Code

```bash
# Navigate to a specific tutorial
cd 01-VAE-Tutorial

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tutorial
jupyter notebook VAE_Tutorial.ipynb
```
